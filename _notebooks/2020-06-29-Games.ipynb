    "As any good mathematician does, I started by defining clear, unambiguous notation. In particular, I settled on denoting the teams simply by their numbers $i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$, and games by $G = A, B, C, D, E$. There is also the additional constraint of *rounds*: a team can't be in two places at the same time, so you have to have multiple rounds of games. I simply denote these $n= 1, 2,...$. As we will see, we can get away with exactly 5 rounds.\n",

    "After a false start of looking at [integer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming) formulations of the problems, I remembered that last year I watched a super nice talk by Raymond Hettinger: [Modern solvers: Problems well-defined are problems solved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GP9OpZPUYc). In that talk, he talks about leveraging generic solvers to solve all kinds of problems.  \n",
    "One of the problems he looks at is satisfiability, or the question whether a certain logical formula can be true, and if so, what assumptions make it true. That is a good fit for this problem, so I decided to use the code he made available at [rhettinger.github.io](https://rhettinger.github.io/einstein.html). If you have a SAT-like problem of your own to solve, I would recommend you use it, it makes the whole business quite intuitive.\n"
