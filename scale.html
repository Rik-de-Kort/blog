<h1>Loose notes about scaling</h1>
Link between programming and bureaucracy
<ul>
    <li>A computer program is a collection of inflexible specifications of processes. So our bureaucracies.</li>
    <li>Primary difference: the executor in a computer program is a machine, in a bureaucracy it's one or multiple people.</li>
    <li>Programmers consistently overlook escape hatches from the fixed path. "I want to talk to the manager", the justice system, etc. Bureaucracies tend to have some mechanism for arbitration/adjucation. Computer programs much less so.</li>
    <li>This is also relevant for blockchain tech: is this lack of arbitration worth it because the current arbitration is so shit?</li>
</ul>

Regulation and bureaucracy:
<ul>
    <li>Bureaucracy is a tool for scaling processes. You take trust in people and put it in processes.</li>
    <li>Most people (including regulators) want principle-based regulation. Protect your customers, etc. However, this does not scale because it requires unique insight in every individual case. Hence, compliancy bureaucracy.</li>
    <li>That's not to say that we should give up looking for principles-based regulation. There's a difference between functional and sclerotic bureaucracy. An example of the former is renewing your driver's license. An example of the latter is the GDPR compliancy.</li>
</ul>

Scaling to what?
<ul>
    <li>"Scaling" is too narrow a term. A lot depends on how far you want to scale. Millions of users can probably still use a simple websites that's one 1-2 servers.</li>
    <li>A lot of architecture astronauting happens here: people building unnecessary (distributed) things because "it scales".</li>
    <li>"Life Happens in the Pre-Asymptote" - N.N. Taleb. A lot of Taleb's work is about pre-asymptotics, and they matter!</li>
</ul>
