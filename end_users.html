<h1>Your users aren't telling you your software is crap</h1>
<p>
A lot of software has annoying bugs, or simply doesn't work very well. But clearly, people are just taking the crap and trying to find work arounds. This is a page where I collect examples of end-users working around crappy software. I suspect it will either grow over time or die a silent death. Let me know if you find some more (Github and Twitter are on my <a href="index.html">homepage</a>). I'm specifically interested in finding the workarounds.

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9913">InvalidArchiveError when installing yfinance library</a>: basically people trying to install yfinance using conda, which straight up does not work, and they end up finding extracting the archive manually. And following other "magic steps" that hopefully work. (This is incidentally also what fixing stuff on Linux feels like a lot of the time; too bloody intricate). </li>
