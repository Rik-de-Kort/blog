<h1>Technical and functional risk</h1>
<p>
  Software engineers really hate spreadsheets.
  Not a week passes by at work without hearing "we really need to stop doing all of this stuff in Excel".
  The alternative is, of course, writing a "proper" software system, with version control, automated tests, and a repeatable deployment pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  These are all great things to have, but they are all mitigations for <em>technical</em> risks.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Version control helps to prevent proliferation of different versions of the system.</li>
  <li>Automated tests prevent the implementation of the system differing from the specification.</li>
  <li>A repeatable deployment pipeline ensures that the system in use is consistent and always the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We can define technical risk as those risks that are applicable to all systems, no matter the domain.
  In contrast, we can look at <em>functional</em> risks: risks that are domain-specific.
  In other words, the risk that the system does not fulfill its intended task, because it does the wrong thing.
</p>
<p>
  This is a big risk!
  Common sentiment amongst software developers is that it's not hard to figure out how to build a system, it's hard to figure out what it needs to do.
  It's more or less why agile was invented, why <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/">product-minded engineers</a> are sought after.
</p>
<p>
  And those spreadsheets?
  They are built by the users themselves, often in response to a direct need.
  The output is checked closely, because the results matter.
  They carry very little functional risk, and that's (objectively!) a great advantage.
  They ain't half-bad!
