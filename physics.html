    <h1>The "laws of physics" for software</h1>
    <p>Ever heard how Fred Brooks said the programmer works only slightly removed from "pure thought-stuff". Anything you can imagine, you can build! A conclusion people seem to draw from this idea is that there are no rules governing software. Another thing I commonly encounter is the opposite: a plethora of rules governing "good" software. "Only comment the 'what', never the 'how'", "a function can never be more than 7 lines long", "composition over inheritance". I think both of these are misguided, and both are quite common, so I wanted to write on what I think <em>are</em> "laws" for software: statements about software that are true always, regardless of context.
    </p>

    <p>To find out what these laws are, consider that everything has to have some interface with reality: it has to have impact on reality and has to be impacted by reality. This is how we discover the laws of physics: we observe that an apple, once released, falls down to the ground, and so we discover gravity. To discover "the laws of physics" of software, we need to look at where software touches reality. Here is a first list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The software is interacted with. If the software exposes an interface (like a webapp), the user and their system is part of the external reality of the software. The programmer working on the software can be seen as a special case of this: the source code is an interface.</li>
        <li>The software is executed by a computer. This usually has some effect on memory in the computer, and can have further downstream effects such as the opening of bridges, transfer of asset ownership, your toast popping up, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Programmers that work on software</h2>
    <p>
    Which restrictions do these external realities impose on the software? For the work of programmers, there are several limitations. The ones that come to mind immediately are the capacity of their machines, the availability of memory, etc. More importantly, though, there are limitations in the programmers themselves. Human memory is not infinite and the complexity of information that one can grasp is limited, and as more programmers are introduced to a project, communication quickly becomes a bottleneck. A line of Python saying <code>bm = sorted((r for r in data if r.sedol in bm_sedols), key=lambda t: mc[t] / sum(mc.values()))</code> might be perfectly legible to me: it's just finding records belong in some benchmark, sorting them by market cap. But if you don't know what a benchmark is in this context, that a sedol is an identifier, what market cap is, you are lost. Or what if you don't know Python, or you do know Python, but you don't know about list comprehensions, or the optional <code>key</code> argument to <code>sorted</code>?
    </p>
    <p>
    Programming is a lot like writing in this way. The writing needs to be appropriate to the audience, and take them into account. If not, the writing is ineffective and doesn't achieve its intended goal. So with programming, it matters not only what the program is doing, but also who you are writing it <em>for</em>. Their knowledge and taste fundamentally constrains how you can write your program.
    </p>
    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>
    A direct corollary is a guideline for comments. Which is to say: it depends on who the comments are for. A common guideline like "comment the what, not the how" becomes much easier to apply with this in mind. More importantly, it becomes much easier to <em>break</em> the guideline when you need to.
    </p>
    <p>
    Take the code below as an example. You don't really need to write the <code>Highest first</code> because <code>sorted</code> sorts lowest first and has the <code>reverse</code> argument. And the comments <code>Plenty of room</code>, <code>Not enough room</code>, and <code>All weight gone</code> are arguably superfluous: you can just read out from the code that if <code>t</code> is the target position and <code>t <= remaining_weight</code>, we can set the actual position to <code>t</code>, right?
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm the main maintainer of this code, so these comments are mostly for me. I can never remember what order <code>sorted</code> puts things in, and besides, <code>reversed</code> as an argument is weird (Pandas got it right by using <code>ascending</code> instead). To me, reading the comment <code>Plenty of room</code> indicates what the hieroglypics to the left of it mean, in plain language. You can argue until the cows come home about whether these are good comments, but they are good <em>for me</em>, and since I have to deal with this code in production and fix it if it's wrong, that is the final word.
    </p>
    <pre><code>sorting_key = sorted(
    range(len(total_return)), key=lambda i: total_return[i], reverse=True
)  # Highest first
target_position = [target_pos[i] for i in sorting_key]

# Execute algorithm: fill target position until capacity is reached
remaining_weight = capacity
position = []
for t in target_position:
    if t <= remaining_weight:  # Plenty of room
        position.append(t)
    elif remaining_weight > 0:  # Not enough room, use up remaining weight
        position.append(remaining_weight)
    else:  # All weight gone
        position.append(0)
    remaining_weight -= position[-1]

# Unsort and return answer
trade = [
    position[sorting_key.index(i)] - w for i, w in enumerate(portfolio_weight)
]</code></pre>

    <h3>The power of standardization</h3>
    <p>
    Another application of this force is the success of the programming language Go. By restricting the power of the language, Go creates uniformity, which is often useful in communication. The receiver knows what to expect and has less overhead dealing with the sender's idiosyncrasies. For instance, if you want to apply some function <code>f</code> to a slice <code>items</code>, here's how to do it:
    </p>
    <pre><code>var result []int
for index, item := range items {
    result = append(result, f(item))Wh
}</code></pre>
    <p>
    In Python, however, I can immediately think of three reasonable ways to do it:
    </p>
    <pre><code># List comprehension
result = [f(item) for item in items]

# For loop
result = []
for item in items:
    result.append(f(item))

# Builtin map function
result = map(f, items)</code></pre>
    <p>
    There are arguments to be made for and against each of these ways, but in Go there is no such discussion. Go has no list comprehensions or <code>map</code>-builtin. There's only one reasonable way to do it. And if you are reading other people's code, you only need to understand the one way to do it for Golang, but understand three ways to do it for Python (if you are unlucky).
    </p>
    <p>
    Of course, this standardization also has downsides. I prefer the list-comprehension style in Python since it's closer to the natural language description of the task. It's a bit like writing a book using the only the 1000 most common English words: you have to say "food-heating radio box" instead of "microwave". So "you should standardize things" is not a law, but the underlying force shaping this balance is still communication.
    </p>

    <h2>Users interacting with software</h2>
    <p>
    Most software has a non-trivial use. It is often used by people who did not create the software, who do not necessarily understand the underlying mental model that the programmer writing the software had (if they had). This is a major source of variability. At least programmers have the ability to think rigorously about the computer in common. Users may not have this ability, and consider the computer to be more or less a magic box.
    </p>

    <h2>A user interacts with the software</h2>
    <p>
    Programmers at least share the ability to talk to the computer in a programming language, but users run the gamut from a 75-year old hacker who could write the same software in a weekend to a 3-year old using a computer for the first time. You can even count other computer programs as users (ever tried having a go at fuzz testing?) Without making any other assumptions, it is really hard to pin down any regularity from the reality of users using your software, other than tthe reality of users using your software, other than that there is going to be a lot of variation.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, it does point to a simple maxim: plan for variation. Often I feel like people take that to mean that one should really try to lock down the system and try to prevent any unforeseen actions from occurring. This is a never-ending battle and (in my experience) leads to fighting demons that don't exist. Rather, it's worth to focus on the things that are really crucial, be it some process that must always be available, or some data invariants that must never be broken, and build the rest of the system flexibly around that. An example:
    </p>
    <p>
    For an investment management team at work I maintain a system that collects information and their views on their investable universe. The system is also used to generate trade proposals from this information. Even if the data from one name in the universe is unavailable, for instance due to a data error in one of the sources, the system should still display all other relevant information. You can't just simply blow up at the first <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> you see.
