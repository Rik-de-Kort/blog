<h1>A list of bugs I encounter</h1>
Just an unordered list of bugs or unexpected quirks I encounter while at my main desktop.
<ul>
<li>In a jupyter notebook, tqdm's in-place error bar stops being in-place if you interrupt the kernel once while using it.</li>
<li>Jupyter notebook "magically" changes over insert mode, overwriting previously-written code.</li>
<li>Importing a flat file using SQL Server Management studio, checking "Rich type detection" after already viewing the columns gave an inscrutable error message about ComboBoxDropdown not being valid, and I needed to handle the DataError first. Clicking OK just popped up the same box again. Of coursde it also locked me out of doing anything else. Luckily spamming Escape fixed it.</li>
<li>Installing Zen Blue Lite software gives no errors, but then the application won't open and just crash on startup.</li>
<li>Clicking "too fast" in Microsoft's Delve for company information deselects a filter box but then doesn't update the results.</li>
<li>Using Firefox Focus on mobile, reading a Steve Yegge blog post results in the "got it" option for the cookie banner being hidden underneath the "destroy history" button. You have to do some risky touch gymnastics to click it.</li>
<li>In my homegrown notetool, starting the application before syncing the data will result in data loss.</li>
<li>There was a floaty black bar on the calendar in microsoft teams, like you see when you can move a window around.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why don't you fix these yourself?</h1>
Some software I can't fix because it's closed source.

Most software I won't fix because it is too much of an effort to get to know these sprawling code bases merely to fix a few bugs.

My own software I will sometimes fix, if I feel like it.
