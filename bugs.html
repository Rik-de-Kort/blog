<h1>A list of bugs I encounter</h1>
Just an unordered list of bugs or unexpected quirks I encounter while at my main desktop.
<ul>
<li>In a jupyter notebook, tqdm's in-place error bar stops being in-place if you interrupt the kernel once while using it.</li>
<li>Jupyter notebook "magically" changes over insert mode, overwriting previously-written code.</li>
<li>Importing a flat file using SQL Server Management studio, checking "Rich type detection" after already viewing the columns gave an inscrutable error message about ComboBoxDropdown not being valid, and I needed to handle the DataError first. Clicking OK just popped up the same box again. Of coursde it also locked me out of doing anything else. Luckily spamming Escape fixed it.</li>
<li>Installing Zen Blue Lite software gives no errors, but then the application won't open and just crash on startup.</li>
<li>Clicking "too fast" in Microsoft's Delve for company information deselects a filter box but then doesn't update the results.</li>
<li>Using Firefox Focus on mobile, reading a Steve Yegge blog post results in the "got it" option for the cookie banner being hidden underneath the "destroy history" button. You have to do some risky touch gymnastics to click it.</li>
<li>In my homegrown notetool, starting the application before syncing the data will result in data loss.</li>
<li>There was a floaty black bar on the calendar in microsoft teams, like you see when you can move a window around.</li>
<li>Clicking on "Home" while in the Outlook Calendar view from "Meeting" jumped back to meeting after half a second.</li>
<li>Links in error messages for Microsoft products tend to be broken. An SSL error message in PowerBI leads me to the "What's New"-page for ADO.NET.</li>
<li>Random button saying "Minimize" when opening PyCharm. Clicking it doesn't do anything. Turns out it came from PowerBI!</li>
<li>Microsoft Teams room installation doesn't show video or send video. After restarting it does show video, but still doesn't show any. Was unable to resolve.</li>
<li>Clicking on a picture in Microsoft teams leads the screen to be empty and unresponsive until I switch over to a different chat, closing the picture.</li>
<li>Pinterest doesn't load a shared board in Firefox (with some privacy-friendly settings). Clicking on 'Get Help' redirects after 1 second.</li>
<li>Outlook keeps popping up the same "welcome to the new search" message, even though I already have had this version of Outlook for a couple months. Probably desktop-as-a-service related, but still annoying. Also it pops over the browser window sometimes.</li>
<li>Extracting a moderately-sized ZIP-archive (60 MB) takes forever and crashes Windows Explorer.</li>
<li>Opening Spotify on my phone and clicking on a song does literally nothing until I restart the application.</li>
<li>Reddit preview links don't do anything on the old style site.</li>
<li>Interrupting a Jupyter notebook kernel mid-import puts it in a broken state. Module numpy has no attribute __config__ when trying to import pandas.</li>
<li>Notification dot on Calls tab does not disappear in Microsoft Teams.</li>
<li>Whatsapp Web does not show a newline inserted using shift+return until typing the next word.</li>
<li>Landing on a Facebook page prevents me from going back to the previous page. Unless it's on Facebook.</li>
<li>Scrolling breaks in Jupyter notebooks on output cells which don't have any scrollbar.</li>
<li>Front page for Azure Repos hijacks the back-button, have to click twice to get back to search.</li>
<li>Having the suggestions box open when addressing email in Outlook breaks the delete button.</li>
<li>Random crash of Microsoft Teams in Chromium.</li>
<li>Accidentally exit a webinar in Teams, takes 5 minutes to come back because it asks me "are you still there" and then breaks the video feed.</li>
<li>Teams webinar chat does not scroll.</li>
<li>You have to press tab twice to hop to the password field in the Discord login form.</li>
<li>Clicking "join" in a teams meeting instead closes the call.</li>
<li>Viewing an Excel file in Teams during a call bugs out: call window keeps getting dragged around.</li>
<li>Random disconnect in Microsoft Teams even though internet is fine.</li>
<li>Teams scrolling up is fucked.</li>
<li>Starting an Orbit review from Firefox Focus on my phone leads to a blank page.</li>
<li>Opening Google search in Firefox on my work computer makes links not-clickable.</li>
<li>Opening Microsoft Teams in the browser and clicking on chats redirects to another app after a second.</li>
<li>YouTube's channel search box jumps around weirdly when trying to select text.</li>
<li>YouTube not opening full screen, instead cursor seems to flip-flop between being over two urls?</li>
<li>Random resizing of the screen in VMWare Horizon, leading to the actual contents of the screen getting stuck in the top left corner on a tiny rectangle.</li>
<li>SQL Server Management Studio literally prevented my workstation from shutting down entirely.</li>
<li>Steam website asks me to log in twice and also 2FA twice if I reject cookies. Hello, local store? Necessary cookies only?</li>
<li>Clicking on a picture in Microsoft Teams shows nothing, also hides the chat messages.</li>
<li>Muting/unmuting is reversed for a participant in Teams meetings.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why don't you fix these yourself?</h1>
Some software I can't fix because it's closed source.

Most software I won't fix because it is too much of an effort to get to know these sprawling code bases merely to fix a few bugs.

My own software I will sometimes fix, if I feel like it.
