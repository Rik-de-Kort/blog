<h1>Styles of programming</h1>
<p>
  At work I encounter a lot of programmers who would like to improve their codebases. The debates surrounding this often use terms like "object-oriented" or "functional". A lot of the time, this is missing the forest of the trees a little: there are many things that are much more important than "object-oriented" versus "functional".
  This post is an attempt to articulate the things that matter, and on the way I hope we can maybe shed some light on "object-oriented" versus "functional".

<h2>What matters most</h2>
<p>
  Most programs fall in one of two categories.
	The first is a program that runs start-to-finish. Maybe it runs on a timer, every day or every week. The job of the program is usually to take data from somewhere, maybe multiple places, do something to that data, and write the result out somewhere else. Examples of this are a program to predict which partners are not going to deliver their information on time, or a program that calculates the total carbon footprint of the investment portfolio.
	The second is a program that needs to interact with the world. This interaction can be with a human, or with another system. The job of the program is to provide insight to a user, or to react to changes in the outside world. Examples of this are a program to trade (maybe algorithmically) currencies on an exchange, or an interactive application to understand why some partners are expected to deliver their information late.

	The most important thing in a program is data. Whatever kind of program you have, the only thing a computer can do is take data from a place, transform it, and put it in another (or the same) place. Elegant programs are precise, clear instructions about what needs to go where.

  The hardest thing in algebra is the bookkeeping. If you have six variables and you try to solve for another 4, you are bound to make a mistake somewhere unless you're really really careful. Programming is the same: the hardest thing is the bookkeeping. Wh
