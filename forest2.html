<h1>Styles of programming</h1>
<p>
  At work I encounter a lot of programmers who would like to improve their codebases. The debates surrounding this often use terms like "object-oriented" or "functional". A lot of the time, this is missing the forest of the trees a little: there are many things that are much more important than "object-oriented" versus "functional".
  This post is an attempt to articulate the things that matter, and on the way I hope we can maybe shed some light on "object-oriented" versus "functional".
</p>
<h2>What matters most</h2>
<p>
  The most important thing in a program is data.
 Whatever kind of program you have, the only thing a computer can do is take data from a place, transform it, and put it in another (or the same) place.
 Elegant programs are precise, clear instructions about what needs to go where.
 Achieving clarity about what needs to happen in terms of data is the first step in writing better code.
 The second step is expressing what needs to happen in terms of data in code.
 The main goal here is to make it obvious to others reading the code what is happening and how it is happening.
</p>
<p>
  So, how can you take the first step, achieving clarity? One tool here is writing: write explicitly down where data is coming from and what it looks like.
 Then write down explicitly where data needs to go and what it looks like.
 Start technical: don't worry too much about what the data means. Instead, focus on where data comes from, what kind of data it is, and what kind of data needs to be produced (numbers, text, ...), where it needs to go (fileshare, database, ...).
	Talk this sketch of the technical system over with someone and try to make it as simple as possible.
	Don't write to a fileshare <em>and</em> a database if you can help it, don't write to two tables if you can write to just one, and try to avoid "multiple ways of saying the same thing".
	This last point already touches on the meaning of the data a little more.

  Most programs fall in one of two categories.
  The first is a program that runs start-to-finish. Maybe it runs on a timer, every day or every week. The job of the program is usually to take data from somewhere, maybe multiple places, do something to that data, and write the result out somewhere else. Examples of this are a program to predict which partners are not going to deliver their information on time, or a program that calculates the total carbon footprint of the investment portfolio.
  The second is a program that needs to interact with the world. This interaction can be with a human, or with another system. The job of the program is to provide insight to a user, or to react to changes in the outside world. Examples of this are a program to trade (maybe algorithmically) currencies on an exchange, or an interactive application to understand why some partners are expected to deliver their information late.
