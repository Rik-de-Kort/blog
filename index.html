My name is Rik, I'm into acrobatics, cooking, computers, dancing, languages, mathematics, and weightlifting. I currently work for a large pension administration company and investment management firm in the Netherlands. Together with our Program Manager, I run the company's Datalab, which combines knowledge of financial markets and pension administration with knowledge of IT to make our company better at technology.
