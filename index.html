<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
<p>
My name is Rik, I'm into acrobatics, cooking, computers, dancing, languages, mathematics, and weightlifting. I currently work for a large pension administration company and investment management firm in the Netherlands. Together with our Program Manager, I run the company's Datalab, which combines knowledge of financial markets and pension administration with knowledge of IT to drive technological transformation.

I believe most things are understandable at some sufficiently low level of detail (first reason for the name "Nothing Isn't Trivial"). Sort of the opposite of just "vibing along" to things we don't understand (<a href="https://twitter.com/sarahlostctrl/status/1438958822543011849">reference</a>), though I think "vibing along" is good, as long as it doesn't prevent you from looking deeper when you can.

Additionally, I believe the concept of "Nothing" is quite tricky (second reason for the name "Nothing Isn't Trivial"): taken at face-value it's some kind of invitiation into Nihilism or zombieness, and getting from there into more meaningful pursuits is not something I can articulate how to do. It feels magical!  Here's a quote from <a href="https://kitlaughlin.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1244-on-right-livelihood-or-get-your-dreams-done/page/2/&tab=comments#comment-17178">Kit Laughlin</a> on the subject, which sums it up pretty nicely:
