I am a Data Scientist at [PGGM](https://pggm.nl/en), a large pension administrator in the Netherlands. I have a degree in the Mathematics of Computer Science. Besides the obvious interests that come with such a background, my hobbies include aerial acrobatics, piano, fermentation (cooking in general), and language learning.

All opinions expressed on the website are my own.
