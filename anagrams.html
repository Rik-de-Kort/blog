<h1>Detecting Anagrams</h1>
<p>Some time ago on Twitter, Fermat's Library <a href="https://twitter.com/fermatslibrary/status/1275066521450975234">tweeted</a> a cute trick to check if two words are anagrams of eachother: assign each letter a prime number, and compute the product. Two words will be anagrams if and only if the number we obtain in this manner is equal, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">the fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a>.
</p>
<p>
Several users on Twitter were quick to point out that this runs into integer overflow issues very quickly: the letter z is assigned the 26'th prime, which is 101. Already at a string of 10 z's you start having issues.
</p>
<p>
Sometime earlier, I encountered someone on the ##rust channel on Freenode with the exact same issue while working on <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/">this leetcode problem</a>. The problem is a bit more specific because it requires us to group words by anagram status. Deciding to give it a shot, I managed to solve it as follows:
</p>
<p>
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic can be seen as the defining property of mathematical systems known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_factorization_domain">Unique Factorization Domains</a> (UFD's). As it turns out, if we only work with integers modulo some prime (for example, we could do addition and multiplication modulo 29), the polynomials in one variable (say, $x$) turn out to form such a UFD. There are irreducible polynomials (for example $x+1$ and $x+16$) which serve the role of prime factors. Multiplication and addition go as normal for polynomials, and integer arithmetic is modulo 29.
</p>
<p>
Below you'll find the code in Rust. I've tried to push it as fast as it would go (using my poor Rust skills), so it may look a bit hacky to Rust veterans. Additionally, it is written as a leetcode solution, but is easily convertible to a usable function in main(). The polynomials only go up to degree 7 because those are the longest word on leetcode, though the solution is easily extended to any length. There are less overflow issues because we only use numbers between 0 and 28.

<p>Hope you find this interesting!</p>
