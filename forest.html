<h1>Missing the Forest for the Trees</h1>
<p>I always start writing hot on the tails of some flare of an idea, with no guarantee that it'll work out. Here's this one:</p>
<quote>Discussing Object-Oriented Programming versus Functional Programming is missing the forest for the trees</quote>
<p>I'm spurred on by some (quite interesting) <a href="https://www.tedinski.com/2018/01/23/data-objects-and-being-railroaded-into-misdesign.html">work</a> by Ted Kaminski. In the linked post, he makes a distinction between "data" and "objects", based on the following five characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equality and Identity: are two values, say <code>23857</code> and <code>23857</code> always the same, or can they have a different identity?</li>
<li>Mutability: can I turn this <code>23857</code> into <code>23856</code>, or not?</li>
<li>Abstraction: can I hide the details of how <code>Thing</code> is implemented, or is <code>Thing</code> just data?</li>
<li>Extensibility: do I have a fixed set of operations for this <code>Thing</code> (that I might be able to evolve through inheritance), or can I write whatever methods?</li>
</ul>
<p>I grouped equality and identity because they are <em>the same</em>: a notion of equality induces a notion of identity. Things are identical (have the same identity) if they are equal. The question is whether there is only one notion of equality or multiple. In some languages identity is by-value, i.e. two values are the same if they are bit-for-bit equal. In others identity is by-place, i.e. two values are the same thing only if they are at the same spot in memory.</p>

<h2>Places and values</h2>
<p>I think this points at a better distinction: <a href="https://without.boats/blog/pinned-places/">places and values</a>.
At the very basis of it, most programming is operating on bits in memory and transforming them.
The processing unit reads bits from memory, does some calculations on them, then writes them back to memory.
Hopefully the bits it wrote go on to do some good in the world, like showing a nice picture on your computer screen or the answer to your mathematics homework.
To make sure the right bits are written to the right locations, it's essential to know <em>what</em> these bits are (value) and <em>where</em>  they are (place).
</p>
<p>
Programming languages are mostly way of making the problem of dealing with reading, transforming, and writing the right bits from the right spot tractable for humans.
Some ideas that help: encoding higher-level notions as bits, and working with those higher-level notions.
Things like ASCII (<code>00001010</code> means a newline <code>\n</code>), or <a href="https://www.altdevarts.com/p/onboarding-floating-point">floating point numbers</a>, or even integers.
(This is part of what people mean when they say "C is a high-level language".)
</p>
<p>
"Data" in the distinction between "data" and "objects" has a clear story in terms of places and values: the notion of place is completely managed by the programming language.
When you program, you only concern yourself with the values and their transformation. 
It doesn't matter whether your first <code>23857</code> is at the same place your second <code>23857</code>. 
The programming language (compiler/interpreter/runtime) will take care of it.
</p>
<p>
"Objects", on the other hand, don't have such a clear story. Objects do have a place, but this feels almost incidental: in my experience, object identity shows up mostly as a footgun when you are trying to see whether two things are equal: all's well and good when you're slinging integers and strings, but you wrap something in a class (maybe to define a vector type, which still admits addition, multiplication, etc.), and you get completely different behaviour.
</p>
<p>
I think the distinction between "data" and "objects" as explained in Kaminski's text is muddy at best.
Of course, people still debate "functional" versus "object-oriented" programming, which correspond to "data" and "objects", but because the distinction between the two is not clear, the debate cannot be resolved.
</p>
<h2>What are "objects", anyway?</h2>
<p>
Going forward I will use the more common terms "functional" and "object-oriented programming".
</p>
<p>
We already established that the notion of places and values provides a distinction between functional and object-oriented programming: functional languages choose to have places completely managed by the programming language, and you only ever think about values.
 In object-oriented languages, it's typical to have some notion of <em>this</em> object and <em>that</em> object.
</p>
<p>
The next question we should ask is: what <em>is</em> an "object"?
I would argue that an object (as commonly implemented) is a tying together of <em>state</em> and <em>behaviour</em>.
State are the values on <code>self</code> or <code>this</code>, or whatever is the common keyword in your language.
Behaviour are the functions or methods working with those values: either producing new ones, manipulating them, or having side effects.
</p>
<p>
The point of this whole exercise is what fancy people call <em>encapsulation</em>, or information hiding. You can think of an object as a <em>thing</em> that <em>does</em> something.
That's where the common names come from: <code>InformationManager</code>, <code>UserController</code>, <code>Helper</code>, etc. You don't need to know <em>how</em> the information is managed, the user is controlled, or you are getting helped. You can rely on the object to do it for you.
</p>
<p>
But that's strange: we are talking a lot about behaviour, and not so much about state.
What's up with that?
</p>
<p>
To reiterate, the point of programming is to take bits, transform them, and put the result somewhere.
The behaviour described above is doing just that.
You are not <em>supposed</em> to touch the object's state when using it, that's the object's job.
</p>
<p>
This can be very nice to work with, for instance when you have a program that is used for algorithmically trading securities.
You need a part of the program to talk to the exchange, react to data from it, and adjust orders accordingly, but you also need a nice user interface for the trader to see what's happening, to adjust the algorithm mid-run, emergency stop it if necessary, etc.
These two parts of the program cannot interlink too much: the fast part needs to be <em>fast</em>, you cannot spend time making nice graphs for someone to maybe look at.
Notice also that there's a clear concept of what the trading part of the program is <em>doing</em>. Naming it is a bit more difficult, but typically if it's something that has to do with the exchange, this part is doing it.
</p>
<p>
It can also be not so nice to work with, for instance when you need to calculate the square root of the number formed by taking the 1000th to 1250th digits of pi expressed in base 6. First you calculate the relevant digits, and then you calculate the square root. A <code>PiCalculator</code> is not helping you here, it just gets in the way of what you are trying to do. 
</p>
<p>
The difference between these two lies in what state there is to manage.
In the former example, the exchange is continually sending data, and the trading part has to keep track of what algorithms are running, which orders they correspond to, etc. There's a lot of fairly complex state.
Whereas in the latter example, there is no state to speak of. 250 digits of pi, that's it. You can write that out by hand if you want.
</p>
<h2>What are objects not?</h2>
<p>
You are not <em>supposed</em> to touch the object's state (or internals), but this is not always enforced.
For instance, in Python you can do whatever you want to whichever object you want, including builtins.
You can even adjust the behaviour of an object by replacing the methods by functions of your own.
A language like Java has the <code>private</code> keyword that helps with enforcement.
</p>
<p>
A notion of places is not required for objects to exist.
You can emulate any object by writing methods that take in the current state of the object and output the new state (along with whatever other data they produce).
</p>
<br>

<p>
Coming from Python, a method on a class is just a function taking an instance of that class, and you can always replace it with your own function.
There is no such thing as a private method; does that mean that Python does not fall in the "objects" category?
</p>
<p>
I do not think the table is entirely without merit. "Objects" and "data" are clearly pointing at <em>something</em> that a lot of programmers recognize.
However, I think this thinking <em>in general</em> is muddied, and by looking at it from the perspective of places and values, we can start to tease apart some distinctions.
</p>
<h2>"Objects" vs "data", clarified</h2>
<p>
If you want to modify things (i.e. have mutability), you need to embrace the fact that places have a value. You have to be able to <em>point</em> to a value to say "modify that one".
This is not how the "data" or "functional" style operates: we pretend every value we create exists in a diferent place, and so we never have to worry about modifying things, and especially accidentally modifying things.
</p>
<p>
But this alone does not make for an "objects" style, or object-oriented programming. A language like C is definitely not object-oriented, but it does have a notion of place (pointers) and allows you to modify values.
</p>

<p>
Note that this is separate from the notion of encapsulation.

In regular programming, values are data, and places are references, or pointers, or addresses.
