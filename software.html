<h1>Why is software not getting cheaper/better while programmers say their job is getting easier?</h1>

    Most of my programmer friends tell me that chatbots are a massive improvement and their work is now far far more efficient.<br><br>

    As a consumer I have noticed literally no change whatsoever in the quality or price of chatbot-assisted software.<br><br>

    What's going on here?

<p>
    Here is a possible list of reasons/hypotheses. Some from the top of my head, some put forth in the comments. Loosely grouped.
</p>

<p>
    Questioning the premises: LLMs are not a massive improvement for programmers.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The people Ben talks too are not representative.</li>
    <li>Programmers are exaggerating how much it helps them. Benefits, if any, will be modest.</li>
    <li>LLMs do speed up programmers, but they also introduce new problems (bugs/hallucinations) that eat away the improvement.</li>
</ol>

<p>Questioning the premises: programming is fake to begin with.</p>
<ol>
    <li>People just suck at programming in general. The great majority of programmers can't <em>really</em> program. Doing nothing 100x times faster is still doing nothing.</li>
    <li>Programming is a bullshit job. You can't automate away a bullshit jobs.</li>
</ol>

<p> Questioning the premises: Ben is not noticing the improvements.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Programmers are building programmer tools first before using LLMs to make money on consumer facing software</li>
    <li>Benefits are only in the long tail, i.e. an app goes from 98.9% reliable to 99.9% reliable.</li>
    <li>The difference is only visible in shipping speed, not price/quality.</li>
    <li>Most software work is not user-visible, so speedups are not user-visible.</li>
    <li>The garbage backlog is so large that it will take years for the impact to become visible.</li>
    <li>People are building a lot of cash flowing side hustles.</li>
</ol>

<p> Software cost and quality is determined by factors other than programmer efficiency.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Good software is primarily created by only allowing a small amount of features. Design is not an LLM constraint.</li>
    <li>There is no bottleneck for programmer productivity for quality and cost of software.</li>
    <li>Red tape around the programming process is the bottleneck. The business doesn't know what they want, etc.</li>
    <li>Distribution is the bottleneck.</li>
    <li>Software pricing is not dominated by development costs, but also marketing/design/etc.</li>
    <li>Software price is 80% gross margin, already price is inelastic so of course price would not go down.</li>
    <li>It's Legal's fault: Large companies don't want to pay for someone else's chatbot, and haven't gotten over the hump of building an in-house one yet.</li>
    <li>It's Legal's fault: Legal is blocking rollout of LLM tools!</li>
</ol>

<p>The value add of LLMs is over a small slice of programming work</p>
<ol>
    <li>Programming is bottlenecked on thinking not typing, so naturally LLMs provide no real benefit.</li>
    <li>LLMs are primarily good at prototyping and exploration, but not production implementation.</li>
    <li>Big projects and already shipped software is already FUBAR, too big to be fixable by LLM.</li>
    <li>LLM capabilities are currently too low so that it's too risky to use them in consumer facing software.</li>
    <li>LLMs can only work on the beaten path, but the real work is off the beaten path.</li>
    <li>The slice of programming work that LLMs optimize is a small slice of all the programming/designing in general.</li>
</ol>

<p>The value add of LLMs is captured before it gets to the consumer.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Companies are delivering the same crap with less headcount.</li>
    <li>Programmers waste more time on other stuff.</li>
</ol>

<p>The value add of LLMs is coming, but later.</p>
<ol>
    <li>It takes a long time for benefits of LLMs to percolate through the economy, it's too early to tell.</li>
    <li>Tooling needs to improve before benefits are realized.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Discussion</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I'm inclined to believe Ben's friends on their word. I experience benefits myself, though not super radical.</li>
    <li>If programming was fake, it would be the missed opportunity of the millenium, because you could get real fucking rich building all that software without all the programmers. Although I do feel sometimes most programmers suck.</li>
    <li>There does seem to be something of an explosion (intuitively, not measured) in lines of code written, and maybe also apps launched? So might be that the day-to-day software Ben uses is just not those new things, but only old things. This dovetails a little with the quibble where the value add of an LLM is.</li>
    <li>I think it's pretty defensible that software cost and quality is determined by other factors than programmer efficiency, but I would like to analyse this more.</li>
    <li>I think the value add only being a small slice of programmer work is in a very similar vein to the above, just that programmer efficiency <em>does</em> matter, just not as much as intuitively thought.</li>
    <li>Value add capture by other parties is interesting: "your margin is my opportunity" etc., so question how you could disrupt this is interesting. Also goes back to market dynamics.</li>
    <li>Delay: also goes back to software market dynamics. How do new ideas percolate through the economy? Are there any similar instances of technology, like printing press, ideas of Marten Luther..., electricity? mobile phones? Steam engine maybe/vs industrialization?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Software cost and quality</h2>
What goes into make software? What goes in selling it? How is software procured across different verticals?
PGGM example, can probably get info on SAP/Salesforce as well. Compare to startup world. Governemnts also fun.
How to get big overview?

<ul>
    <li>B2C SaaS: budgeting software (is that called Minty?), MyFitnessPal</li>
    <li>B2B SaaS for generic B2C: Stripe, Shopify, checkout converters, website builders, etc.</li>
    <li>B2C SaaS for specific vertical: Bingo Card Creator</li>
    <li>B2B SaaS for specific B2B vertical: Causal</li>
    <li>B2B Saas for generic B2B companies: Snowflake, Microsoft Office Suite, Anaplan</li>
    <li>Bespoke software: partnering, consulting, consortiums.</li>
    <li>In-house development.</li>
    <li>Out-house development (haha)</li>
